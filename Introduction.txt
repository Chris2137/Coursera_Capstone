#Introduction/Business Problem

As a food lover, finding a good restaurant for my meals of a day is of fundamental importance.
It would be helpful for either picking places to start a business, rent a house or run a restaurant if I could know the
categories of restaurants in a neighborhood.
Upon clustering neighborhoods by varieties of cuisine, it would be easy to pick a location with most cuisine that
I am in favor of. Or if I am planning to start a restaurant of chinese cuisine, I could easily pick a location
that has less competition, so I could easily stand out. It would also be nice to work in a neighborhoods with lots of my
favorite cuisine around.

To make it more informative, I would also create clustering for both Toronto and New York. With that we could have an overview of
similarities between these two CBD.

Target to help picking location for 
1) Whoever wanted to start a restaurant
2) Gourmet lover who are looking for house
3) Businessman who are looking for office
