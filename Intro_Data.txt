#Introduction/Business Problem

As a food lover, finding a good restaurant for my meals of a day is of fundamental importance.
It would be helpful for either picking places to start a business, rent a house or run a restaurant if I could know the
categories of restaurants in a neighborhood.
Upon clustering neighborhoods by varieties of cuisine, it would be easy to pick a location with most cuisine that
I am in favor of. Or if I am planning to start a restaurant of chinese cuisine, I could easily pick a location
that has less competition, so I could easily stand out. It would also be nice to work in a neighborhoods with lots of my
favorite cuisine around.

To make it more informative, I would also create clustering for both Toronto and New York. With that we could have an overview of
similarities between these two CBD.

Target to help picking location for
1) Whoever wanted to start a restaurant
2) Gourmet lover who are looking for house
3) Businessman who are looking for office

#Data
I will reuse data that we retrieved from labs for both New York and Toronto :
New York Neighborhood and coordinates
https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572
Toronto Postal codes :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
And coordinates to be read from :
http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data

I will be mainly using the Four Square 'search' API to retrieve restaurants information (CATEGORY_ID = '4d4b7105d754a06374d81259')
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search

Neighborhood with too little number of restaurants will not be included in clustering as the distribution may not be too informative,
e.g. one restaurant category could contribute to 25% if a neighborhood has only 4 restaurants.
The threshold for a neighborhood to be considered is set to 10 restaurants.

Example response from search api :
[{'id': '4b8daea1f964a520480833e3',
  'name': 'Grover Pub and Grub',

     'suffix': '.png'},
    'primary': True}],
  'referralId': 'v-1583020118',
  'hasPerk': False}, ...]
  I will mainly amke use of each venue's categories. Note that one venue could belong to multiple category,
  data needs to be further processed to include only category that I am interested in.
