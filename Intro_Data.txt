#Introduction/Business Problem

As a food lover, finding a good restaurant for my meals of a day is of fundamental importance.
It would be helpful for either picking places to start a business, rent a house or run a restaurant if I could know the
categories of restaurants in a neighborhood.
Upon clustering neighborhoods by varieties of cuisine, it would be easy to pick a location with most cuisine that
I am in favor of. Or if I am planning to start a restaurant of chinese cuisine, I could easily pick a location
that has less competition, so I could easily stand out. It would also be nice to work in a neighborhoods with lots of my
favorite cuisine around.

To make it more informative, I would also create clustering for both Toronto and New York. With that we could have an overview of
similarities between these two CBD.


#Data
I will reuse data that we retrieved from labs for both New York and Toronto :
New York Neighborhood and coordinates
https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572
Toronto Postal codes :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
And coordinates to be read from :

I will be mainly using the Four Square 'search' API to retrieve restaurants information (CATEGORY_ID = '4d4b7105d754a06374d81259')
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search

Neighborhood with too little number of restaurants will not be included in clustering as the distribution may not be too informative,
e.g. one restaurant category could contribute to 25% if a neighborhood has only 4 restaurants.
The threshold for a neighborhood to be considered is set to 10 restaurants.
